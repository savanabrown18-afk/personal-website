      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! My name is Savana, and I am passionate
        about furthering my knowledge in web development and coding. A healthy
        work and life balance is very important to me so outside of coding I
        enjoy spending time with my family, going horseback riding, and reading.
      </p>
      <h2>Horseback Riding</h2>
      <p>
        Horseback riding is one of my favorite activities. I find it to be a
        great way to connect with nature and unwind. Whether it's a leisurely
        trail ride or a more challenging course, I always enjoy the experience.

      <h2>Family Time</h2>
      <p>
        Spending quality time with my family is very important to me. We enjoy
        activities like hiking, cooking together, and game nights. These moments
        help strengthen our bond and create lasting memories.

      <h2>Reading</h2>
      <p>
        Reading is another passion of mine. I love getting lost in a good book,
        whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or anything in between. It allows me
        to explore new ideas and perspectives.
